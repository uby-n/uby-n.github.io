      <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
      <p>
        Hello, My name is Ubon Ndon. I am a aspiring Software Developer, and I'm here to introduce myself in my professional
         portfolio. I hope that you enjoy the work I've created. My goal is to become adept enough at software developing/programing
         to be marketable to potential employers. From then on, I intend to become better in the said field in order to 
         be able to associate or assist like colleages and grow together with them over time.

          <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
          <img src="at_beach.jpg" alt="Ubon's picture"  width="350"height="200">
      <p>
       There's really not much to say about me, I do consider myself to be quite bland personality-wise, but I do 
       tend to come up with some very interesting theories. For a quick background, I am originally African but I grew
       up mostly in Milwaukee, WI. I spent a little time in NC for school, before returning to finish my 
       education in Information Technology at the University of Milwaukee Wisconsin.<p>
        After learning the Basics, I continued my education with a City of Milwaukee program that was training IT and Help
        desk support people. It was here that I learned computer hardware. 
        After gaining knowledge of that, I decided it was time to learn to work on software.
       </p>
       <p>
        When not learning new things, I like to (these are not ranked but could be):
        <ol>
          <li>Catch up with movies and shows.</li>
          <li>Catch up with the news.</li>
          <li>Hang out with friends/neighbors/family.</li>
        </ol>
